# Elm Syntax Parser in Rust

## Status

This was one of my first projects in Rust. I ran into troubles with nom macros and then with combine
and then with lalrpop. Now I'm attempting to another approach following the guidance from [Crafting
Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) and you can see that over
[here](https://github.com/michaeljones/erm).
